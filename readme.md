## Lab 4: Map Design and Tile Genration

In this lab I created 4 different maps, 3 of them are using the tweets that were collected from twitter on 4/22 at 8:00PM. Mapbox library
was used for the maps.

### First map: 

#### This is just a simple basemap of the United States, that uses different colors for land and water.
