# Lab 4: Map Design and Tile Genration

In this lab I created 4 different 4 maps, 3 of them are using data that was collected from twitter on 4/22 at 8:00PM.

First map, is just a simple basemap.

Second map, is a layer of a heatmap of the tweets at 8:00PM based on location.

Third map, Is the basemap and a heatmap combined together.

Fourth map, is a map that represnts the heatmap of tweets and different background colors that support Black lives matter.
